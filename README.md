### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a personal developer. My main job is web back-end development, I am a big fan of PHP and proficient in Yii framework and CraftCMS.

Open source is my belief, and you can see some of my achievements here. Of course, most of them are interesting but not useful experiments. 
I will also donate to certain open source foundations that have helped me a lot, such as the PHP Foundation, or some great projects. 
In addition, I'm a fan of JetBrains. I have been using PHPStorm since I was a student, and later used more of their IDEs.

The battle for programming languages never stops, but smart people will use them where they need it most. Some people say that a programming language is just a tool, I don't think so. I chose:

- PHP
- C/C++
- C#
- Swift 
- Go
- JavaScript and TypeScript
- Python 
- Java and Kotlin
